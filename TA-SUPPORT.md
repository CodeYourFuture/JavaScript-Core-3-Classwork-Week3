## 1) Solutions

### 1.1) Where to find solutions?

Add `-Solution` to the end of a repo url to find the solution.

For this repo:

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/JavaScript-Core-1-Classwork-Week1

Find the solutions here:

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/JavaScript-Core-1-Classwork-Week1-Solution

**If you do not have access to these repositories** You must be in the Github Mentors Team to access solutions. Contact your City Coordinator to join our Github Team.

**If the repo does not exist yet**

Someone needs to create it and put some solutions in. Is that someone you?
